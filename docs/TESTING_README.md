# Testing Guide

## Prerequisite
Run `npm install` to ensure all testing dependencies are installed.

## Running Tests
Run `npm test` to execute the test suite (using Jest).

## Troubleshooting
If `npm install` fails with file lock errors (common on Windows), close all terminals or processes using the files and try again.
If `jest` is not found, verify `node_modules/.bin/jest` exists.
